## How we built it

Our website is built using a combination of modern technologies to provide a seamless and robust experience for our users. Here's an overview of the tech stack we have employed:

Frontend:

1. Next.js: We chose Next.js as our frontend framework due to its excellent support for server-side rendering, static site generation, and its seamless integration with React. Next.js enables us to build fast and scalable web applications with ease.

2. TypeScript: To enhance the development process and ensure better code quality, we utilize TypeScript. It provides static typing, allowing for early detection of errors and improved code maintainability. TypeScript helps us write safer and more reliable code.

3. Tailwind CSS: For styling and UI components, we utilize Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable CSS framework. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach, providing a wide range of pre-built classes that facilitate rapid development and consistent design across the website.

Backend:

1. Strapi: As our backend framework, we utilize Strapi, an open-source headless CMS (Content Management System). Strapi allows us to create and manage content easily through a user-friendly interface. It provides a flexible API that enables seamless integration with the frontend.

2. FastAPI: FastAPI is a high-performance Python web framework that we utilize for interacting with AI models. With FastAPI, we can build efficient and scalable API endpoints to handle AI-related tasks, such as model training, prediction, and data processing.

AI Integration:

1. OpenAI API: We leverage the power of OpenAI's API to incorporate AI capabilities into our website. Through the OpenAI API, we can interact with state-of-the-art language models, enabling users to experiment, generate text, and explore various AI applications.
2. LangChain: LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more. The core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs.

The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Strapi, FastAPI, and the OpenAI API allows us to deliver a feature-rich and user-friendly experience on our website. It ensures seamless integration between frontend and backend components, facilitates content management, and unlocks the potential of AI and ML for our users.
